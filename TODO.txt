Architecture
------------

 * Use bower for external JS libs.
 * Frontend should load PSU files individually and parse them directly instead of server.
 * Convert server to node.js - running the DXF generating Python as subprocess.
 * Make the client side load point line once instead of multiple points for each code on the line.

3d Viewer
---------

 * Put circles with labels on the plot in 3d view where objects are now
 * Develop a client-side lookup table for Autocad colours to RGB.
 * Set stringline colour in 3d view according to doncode using client-side lookup.
 * Set stringline thickness according to doncode in 3d view
 * Implement Autocad line styles (dotted, dashed, etc.) in 3d view
 * Stringline - apply correct Autocad line style in 3d view
 * Render contour colour/thickness/style in 3d viewer
 * Job settings - contour offset height - updates in realtime.

Settings editing for XREF, contours
-----------------------------------

 DONE New tab in the UI for settings.
 DONE Set up global settings JSON datastructure that gets loaded from the server
 DONE Global settings - add XREF base path setting
 DONE Set up job settings JSON datastructure with defaults loaded from the server
 DONE Settings UI tab - global settings editable with github DavidDurman/FlexiJsonEditor
 DONE Settings UI tab - job settings editable with github DavidDurman/FlexiJsonEditor
 DONE Make the values in the settings dialogues editable
 DONE If the job settings JSON does not exist, create it with defaults from settings.DEFAULT_SETTINGS_SURVEY

 DONE Job settings - add contour line style, colour, layer
 DONE Job settings - add minor-contour interval distance (mm)
 DONE Job settings - add major-contour multiple of minor

 DONE Pass job settings datastructure to DXF renderer
 DONE Pass global settings datastructure to DXF renderer
 * Render contour colour/thickness/style/layer from job settings datastructure in exported DXF
 DONE Use global XREF setting to prepend to paths when exporting DXF

Saving settings
---------------

 DONE Global settings JSON saved to the server and recalled globally for all jobs
 DONE Job settings JSON saved to the server and recalled when job is loaded 

Blocks
------

 DONE DXF - Put point, label, code, object into the same block
 * DXF - Put blocks on the layer referenced in doncode

Contour fillet/curve
--------------------

 DONE Experiment with DXF Polyline curve settings on contours and send results of various curve tests to Anthony

Multi-day data
--------------

 DONE Aggregating/partitioning multi day data into the JSON data
 DONE Using partitioned multi-day data in all client side viewer
 * Using partitioned multi-day data in DXF export

Scaling
-------

 DONE scaling of tree cell objects relative to original values vs values in the comment attribute of the point
